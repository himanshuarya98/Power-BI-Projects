E-commerce Sales Dashboard - 
The objective of the "E-commerce Sales Dashboard" project appears to be to analyze and visualize sales data from an e-commerce platform. The provided columns offer valuable insights into various aspects of the sales process and customer behavior. This dataset has 10 columns which offers different information about the E-commerce store sales. 
I have created the 3 Calculated Measure in this Dashboard "Average Order Value", "Total Quantity", and "Total Sales". 
By Analyzing this dataset I have found these following insights:
- December Month has Highest Sales
- Sports & Outdoors category has highest quantity of products
- Sports & Outdoors category has highest number of sales
